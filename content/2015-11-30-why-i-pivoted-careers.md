Summary: I didn't start off doing software development.  Yet now I have a job I love that is challenging and I get to learn new things everyday.  And the cherry on top?  I can work from _anywhere_ in the world that has an Internet connection.
Status: draft

I've always had a passion for technology, electronics, computers, and video games.  I was watching some home videos recently, I was probably 7 years old, and Santa got me a GameBoy.  Instantly my brother and I were hooked.  My dad had to pull us away from the game and bring us back to the reality of what was going on around us.

As soon as I got a any new toy or gadget I would want to play with it and push _all_ the buttons.  This kind of drove my dad crazy as he was more methodical and liked to read the instruction manual first.  This tendency to "push all the buttons" carried over into my high school and college years, and is probably why I decided to go into engineering.

Enter high school -- I probably had a typical high school experience except that my fellow students were mostly overachievers trying to get into Ivy League Schools.  This definitely put a little pressure on, but I didn't feel passionate about any subjects in school until I took Physics.  I had a great teacher, Mr. Albanese, who had a laid back, physics is groovy attitude about him.  I definitely wasn't the best student in the class, but I was good at it, and more importantly I thought it was pretty cool.  The fact that I could figure out exactly where a cannon ball was going to land after being shot out of a cannon at at 36 degree angle is pretty nifty.  Finally, I see the point of math.

Enter College -- I knew I wanted to do engineering, probably electrical engineering since I liked Electricity & Magnetism, electrics, and hey, my dad did EE and he did OK.  In college, I Aced my physics class and then signed up for EE.  Freshman year was a breeze for me, I had taken most of the science and math classes in high school already, so no worries there.  Once sophomore and junior year rolled around, the EE classes started getting serious.  OH MAN was there a LOT of math.  I like math now because I see it as a tool to answer questions and solve problems.  But there was SO MUCH math and solving engineering problems that seemed archaic to me.  There were a few practical examples in there, like using electrical motors or building basic radios, but for the most part the program was from the stone age.  I don't think the curriculum had been updated since my Dad went to collect in the 1960's.

So I graduate college -- what do I do?  There really aren't that many "true" Electrical Engineering jobs out there.  Most of the circuit board level work that you think of as classical EE has been commoditized and outsourced to Asia.  I was kind of clueless about what I should do.  Somewhat randomly, Lockheed Martin contacted me and said they might have a gig for me out in upstate New York.  I thought that Military Jets and weapons were pretty badass, so I think I actually applied on their website sometime in my Jr. year for an internship.  So -- I took a job a Lockheed doing Systems Engineering (whatever that is).

Turns out Systems Engineering is a mix of hardware and software engineering -- designing large scale systems and getting them to actually work.  I started off doing ELINT -- Electronic Intelligence systems.  Typically ELINT deals with intelligence derived from radar signals, in my case it was passive radar signals coming off an E2C Navy Airplane.  I was basically going through classified documents and pulling out information to feed into Lockheed's ELINT system that would classify specific radars.  It was fun at first, but got boring quickly.

At that point, I had the opportunity to transfer into a different department that was working on a program called Soothsayer.  This system was a SIGINT system.  SIGINT stands for Signals Intelligence, and is concerned with mostly radio frequency signals.  The signals could be two people talking on radios, or they could be a a launch signal for a nuclear warhead.  Now THIS was interesting.  I actually got to operate on of these systems and use them in the field and test them out.  And if I found something wrong or something that could be improve, I got to **contribute** to improve the system.

While this was all fun and I was doing well at Lockheed and getting attention from upper management, I saw the writing on the wall for the future of the program.  The program was ending soon, and there were no additional contracts or funding in sight.  Time to start planning my exit strategy.  I wanted to continue my work on SIGINT, but there weren't any other opportunities to do this at Lockheed.

So one day, sitting in the Soothsayer Winnebago test vehicle, I looked at the hardware components of the system.  Two of which were DRT and Argon ST.  I figured, hmmm well I've been using their stuff for a while, I can at least tell them that I know how to use their projects.  Surprisedly enough, I got job offers from both(!) companies (located in the DC metro area), but ended up taking an offer with Argon because the work seemed a little more interested and had more room for career growth.

I took a job as Lead System Engineer.  I capitalized 

intro

high school - physics
college - electrical engineering.  interesting, old professors, antiquated
first job - systems engineers, radar ELINT, then SIGINT
1x technology -> 3x
Enter linux, bash and perl scripts, java hacking
2nd floor true combo of HW and SW
Carlo only true HW Mechanical engineer for company, other one got laid off.
Solaris vs Linux -- Linux has community.. enter Stack Overflow
Discover Github... community built around open source software.
Open source community is welcoming and is eager for the new blood.  Especially the python and ruby community.
This is a contrast of what I was used to at my corporate job where people wrote enterprise Java software.  Developers were typically rude, standoffish, and condescending when you tried to learn how the software works.
