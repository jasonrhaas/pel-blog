<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Systems engineer turned software engineer and linux hacker. My focus right now is on big data streams -- especially web and social networks.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong> - I have a M.S. in electrical engineering and 8 years experience as an engineer. I'm good at working independently, getting things done, and leading other engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Skills</strong> -- I'm a Python developer but also do DevOps work and some project management. I'm especially good at using Python and Linux to get things done quickly. I don't prescribe to one doctrine or technology but believe in using the right tool for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong> - Python, bash, linux, git, ELK (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana), ansible, kafka, scrapy, vagrant, docker, storm, spark, hbase.</p>
