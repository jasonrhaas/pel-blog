Well there are a *lot* of options out there for sharing content.  There's of course the social media outlets and then the standard blogging frameworks such as blogger, tumblr, and wordpress.  A lot of people use Wordpress, and I thought about it, but after reading about all the security issues and problems with PHP, I decided to stay away from it.  Also, I am kind of a minimalist and I like things to be as text-based as possible (true to the unix Gods).

There's a site called [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com) that lists all the different website Static Generators and their github popularily, which helped me make my decision.  I originally was going to use **Pelican** because it's python-based, but ultimately decided to go with Jekyll becuase that's what Github pages use to host content, and I <3 Github.  Also - it's popularity means more updates and more support, which is good since I'm new at this.

I started off using **Poole** and **Hyde** but then realized that these were just custom themes on top of Jekyll.  So I am instead just starting with the bare bones Jekyll build.  I like to start off simple, and then build from there.
